# Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus

## Albert Qi

### October 17, 2024

In this repository, I implement dependently typed lambda calculus supporting natural numbers in Coq. I use De Bruijn indicies in order to eliminate any naming issues and easily check for alpha-equivalence via syntactic equality.

Through natural number elimination, I also define addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and factorials. With this simple foundation, I showcase some interesting examples of the language, including the omega combinator, polymorphic identity function, commutative and associative properties, and properties of exponents.
